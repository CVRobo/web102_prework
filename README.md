## Notes

One of the main challenges I encountered in this project was managing the dynamic interaction between JavaScript and the HTML DOM, particularly when it came to updating content in response to user input. For example, making the "Show Unfunded Only" and other filter buttons work correctly required a good understanding of event listeners, DOM manipulation, and the need to clear existing content before appending new elements. Initially, I forgot to use the deleteChildElements function, which led to duplicate content being displayed each time a filter was applied. This taught me the importance of cleaning up the DOM to maintain a seamless user experience.

Another difficulty involved understanding how data was being imported and used. The games data was stored as a JSON string and needed to be parsed correctly to be usable in array operations like filter and reduce. I also struggled with proper image referencing at first, as missing or incorrect paths prevented the images from loading. This experience reinforced the need to verify file structure and use relative paths correctly.

A valuable lesson from this project was the power of built-in JavaScript functions like filter, reduce, and map, which helped process and display data efficiently. I also learned to implement responsive and interactive features using CSS transitions and JavaScript event handlingâ€”for instance, improving UX with a live search bar and responsive button styling.

Overall, this project helped solidify my understanding of DOM manipulation, event-driven programming, and how to structure code for maintainability and user engagement.
